# Olympics-Data-Analysis
## In this project firstly we have split the dataset athlete_events.csv into two , because of the size interruption of github .
#Secondly , This project is divided into 5 different parts so as to  understand the project properly.
        In the First Part:
              1) Import the libraries required.
              2) Read the dataset.
              3) Data Preprocessing (handling the missing values and the irrelevant values).
              4) Understanding the data.
        In the Second Part:
              1) Create Medal Tally of all the countries and years using EDA.
              2) Making the dataframe of country region and medals (total , gold , silver , bronze).
              3) Presenting this in the streamlit and with some specifications and the first interface of our application.
        In the Third Part:
              1) This is the second interface of our application where we show each overall analytics in which we made datraframe of country and years with respect to region. 
              2) We measured Top Stats of the olympics and then we calculated the the various relations 
              3) We then used plotly to plot the graph of each specific relation (python library)
        In the fourth part:
              1) This is the third interface of our application where we first calculated the anlytical data of each country , and find their top athletes , top performances.
              2) Here also we used plotly to show the graph and seaborn to show the heatmap of country representing how many sports and pervformance of those all sports .
        In the Fifth part:
              1) This is the fourth and the last interface of our application where we naalysed the data of each athletes, irrespective of their country , their weight ,height comparison , sex ratio over the years.
